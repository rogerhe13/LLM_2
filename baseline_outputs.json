The Australia international full-back or centre quit the National Rugby League in October to try his luck in American football and was this week given a three-year contract with the San Francisco 49ers. Peter Illfield, chairman of US Association of Rugby League, said: 'Jarryd, at 27, is one of the most gifted and talented rugby league players in Australia. He is an extraordinary athlete. Jarryd Hayne (right) has signed with the San Francisco 49ers after quitting the NRL in October . Hayne, who played rugby league for Australia, has signed a three year contract with the 49ers . 'His three-year deal with the 49ers, as an expected running back, gives the USA Rugby League a connection with the American football lover like never before. 'Jarryd's profile and playing ability will bring our sport to the attention of many. It also has the possibility of showing the American college athlete the possibilities of transition and adaptation for them to play rugby league, should they desire. 'Part of our recruitment strategy is aimed at the American football player who has excelled at High School level but just misses out on their College football team in their Freshman year. Hayne could play at full back or centre in rugby league and is expected to be a running back for the 49ers . 'There is no community football for that high-level of athlete. Rugby league is the perfect sport for him and we now have Jarryd as a first-hand role model.' Illfield has invited Hayne to be a guest of honour at the USARL fixtures in their 14-club competition over the summer, adding: 'We are looking at every source for increasing performance outcomes for the USA national team leading up to the 2017 Rugby League World Cup in Australia and New Zealand.'",

    "article": "An anorexic teenager whose weight dropped to just five stone is fighting back from the condition by setting up a catering business. Faith March, 18 from Maldon, Essex, was surviving on nothing other than coffee when she dropped to her lowest weight in March of last year. After several ill-fated attempts to fight the illness, Faith collapsed in her bathroom where she was found by her boyfriend - and her family told her they feared for her life if she didn't get help. Scroll down for video . Faith March's weight dropped to just five stone when she was suffering from anorexia (left) but she is now in recovery and has set up her own patisserie business (right) After treatment at the Priory Hospital in Chelmsford, Faith is now at a healthier weight and credits the starting of her patisserie business, Whisk of Faith, as kick-starting her recovery. Faith said: 'This business has helped me get out of a massive hole. If I'm honest, it was a hole I never thought I would get out of. It just seemed like a never-ending cycle of problems.' Faith says she has had problems with her stomach which have baffled doctors for most of her life, but at 14 she was finally told her colon had collapsed and had surgery to insert a stent into her stomach. That returned her to some sort of normality, but in March last year her eating problems began to worsen and those around her began to notice. Faith said: 'My boyfriend, mum and dad noticed I had stopped eating again, I was just surviving on coffee,' she said. 'I was doing a cookery course at the time as well as working part time at a pub so I was surrounded by food but I just couldn't bring myself to eat anything. Faith looks happy as she poses with some of her cooking equipment and her freshly baked goods . Faith looks happy as she poses in her chefs outfit complete with an apron with the name of her company on the front . 'My boss told me to take some time out because it was clear I wasn't 100 per cent so I went to the doctors and that is when I was told I had anorexia. 'I knew I always had problems with food but to actually be diagnosed as anorexic just played havoc with my mind. Faith continued: 'I tried to combat it in so many ways that I look back on now and think 'what was I doing?' such as just staying in bed, working out at the gym all the time and just generally not accepting help. Then, a terrifying episode later that year made it hit home just how bad her problem was. Faith said: 'After one long day working from 11am until 10pm at the pub in which I hadn't eaten, my boyfriend found me collapsed on the bathroom floor. Faith's weight plummeted to just five stone but she is not much healthier (right) Pretty Faith poses with her boyfriend Alex who raised the alarm after he discovered her collapsed on the bathroom floor . 'I can't remember much about what happened but he said I couldn't go back there as I was just too unwell. 'We went on holiday and my family told me they thought I would die if I carried on working in that environment. 'It hit me then. I realised something needed to be done to save my life. Faith quit her job and spent time at home recuperating, which got her thinking about ways to get herself better. 'I always wanted my own business so Mum told me to maybe do some work for myself while I get better,' she said. 'I had been at cooking college and it was something I wanted to do for a living, so I started doing cakes and getting people ordering from me and it's just grown from there.' Brave Faith sought treatment for her anorexia at the Priory Hospital in Chelmsford . Faith says that having her new business has helped her to start eating again after suffering for years with anorexia . Mum Heather has been helping out and Faith said that, while there is still a long way to go for both her condition and her business, she is optimistic for the future. 'I still have to have check-ups twice a week but I'm weighing just over eight stone now which is a lot healthier than I was,' she said. 'My parents have been so supportive by letting me run the business from home and my boyfriend has been a tower of strength as well. 'The business started small but it has just kept growing and growing. Of course I still have bad days when I barely eat anything but as a result of starting the business I'm now eating a lot more and worrying a lot less.'

    "article": "(CNN)For years, they've wanted six seasons and a movie, and at 3:01 a.m. ET Tuesday, fans got it ... almost. There's no movie yet, but \"Community's\" much-awaited sixth season made its debut. Not even cancellation by NBC could kill the fan favorite sitcom, as Yahoo streamed the first two episodes of the new season early Tuesday. The show appears to have suffered no decline in quality in the move to Yahoo, though cast member Yvette Nicole Brown (now on CBS' \"The Odd Couple\") had to leave the show for family reasons. The premiere briefly touches on this in its own way, with Shirley's absence sounding a lot like the setup for a spinoff (as the character Abed points out, along with several other inconsistencies throughout the episode). The \"new Shirley,\" as Dean joked, is Paget Brewster's Frankie, who exists to play the disapproving authority figure to antagonize the former study group. Soon, the group was running a Prohibition-esque bar before they could learn to live with Frankie. And how about the end of the first episode, which gave us a look at the spinoff, \"The Butcher and the Baker,\" with Shirley and Steven Weber as a Southern lawyer? Episode two got even more out there, with Dean Pelton's adventures in 1990s-style virtual reality and a less-successful plotline involving Britta's parents. Most interesting was the introduction of Keith David as '90s tech genius Elroy. Critics praised the show, with The Hollywood Reporter's Amy Amatangelo saying, \"Everything fans loved about Community remains -- the first two episodes are chock-full of increasingly bizarre pop-culture references (Portuguese Gremlins, anyone?) and meta commentary. The show has seamlessly transferred to an online venue.\" Time's James Poniewozik also liked it (despite some reservations about the plot), writing, \"The first thing that matters is if the latest reboot still has the comedy goods, and it does.\" Soon after the show went online, devoted fans on Twitter had their say.",

The success of Ms Fairbanks's tweet and the subsequent party invite has touched the hearts of people across the world, with many social media users deeming the story 'amazing' and tear-jerking. Sean was first pictured dancing enthusiastically at what appeared to be a concert last month. But after the bullying cameraman and his friend started laughing at him, he bowed his head in shame. The bullies later uploaded the two, contrasting photos of Sean to the anonymous message board, 4chan, alongside the nasty message labeling him a 'specimen' and criticizing his carefree dancing. The post was then screenshot and posted on Imgur, where it attracted the attention of thousands of social media users, including Ms Fairbanks, who said she was 'horrified' by its 'cruel' nature.

'Kind-hearted gesture': Although the group were concerned of embarrassing Sean by tweeting the photos, they decided that the benefits of successfully locating and standing up for the Dancing Man outweighed the risks . Supporting Sean: Emma Roid tweeted to Sean: 'If you see this, we want you to know that we've got your back' More support: Another user, with the handle @tinypants', said she hoped someone on Twitter could identify Sean - before his name was revealed. 'Half the Internet wants to give him a hug,' she wrote, using the hashtag . Fellow dancing enthusiast: Charlie Heapy added: 'We need to #FindDancingMan and have a big dancing party!'

And just hours later, the Dancing Man himself set up a Twitter account to reply to Ms Fairbanks - and posted a photo of himself holding up a sign reading: 'Hi Cass & Twitter (as requested!).'

    "article": "(CNN)One is a former high school cornerback who also loves baseball. The other is a football  fan who also played competitive golf. The two University of Oklahoma students at the center of a racist fraternity video have more than sports in common. They're both under fire since the nine-second clip showed them making racial slurs against blacks. In it, students at the now-disbanded Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity clap, pump their fists and laugh as they hurl racial slurs and make a reference to lynching. School officials have expelled Parker Rice and Levi Pettit because of their alleged \"leadership role\" in the racist chant. Here's what we know about the two students: . Rice, 19,  was raised in Dallas, where he recently graduated  from Jesuit College Preparatory School. In high school, he was an avid sportsman, and he played cornerback on the football team, in addition to baseball, The Dallas Morning News reported. His father, Bob Rice, is a real estate agent in Dallas, where he volunteers for various organizations, including a baseball league and the local YMCA, according to the newspaper. Earlier this year, a sibling of the younger Rice described their close relationship in an interview with their high school newspaper. In the article, the brother says they enjoy playing video games and watching movies together. Rice has apologized for the video, calling his actions wrong and reckless. \"I made a horrible mistake by joining into the singing and encouraging others to do the same,\" he said in a statement Tuesday. His family has fled their home, where protesters gathered Wednesday. They've also wiped out their social media accounts. As the university tries to heal after days of controversy, some are rallying to Rice's defense. Matthew Lopez,  a friend and fellow student at the university, said the video is not a reflection of who he is. \"That video does not represent his core personality,\" Lopez said. \"Unfortunately though, as things are, that might define him for a while. But it does not define him personally, I feel.\" Lopez described him as a \"charismatic, good person, with a good soul and a good spirit\" who experienced a lapse in judgment. \"His behavior is a result of his influence of the fraternity system and the traditions that have been embedded since pre-civil war times, when the fraternity was made, which obviously weren't the most tolerant times,\" Lopez said. The second student expelled, Pettit does not have much of a digital footprint. What appears to be his now deleted Twitter page mainly focuses on his musings about college football. Pettit played golf at his alma mater, Highland Park High School, The Dallas Morning News reported. In a statement, his parents said their son made a horrible mistake and apologized to African-Americans, students and university faculty. \"He is a good boy, but what we saw in those videos is disgusting,\" Brody and Susan Pettit said. \"While it may be difficult for those who only know Levi from the video to understand, we know his heart, and he is not a racist.\" CNN has reached out to both students but has not heard back from Rice. A spokesman for the Pettit family declined CNN's request for an interview.",

    "article": "A new ad starring a 'realistic' fashion doll with curves, stretch marks and a 'normal' sized body is trying to change women's perceptions of their bodies. Plastic doll Lammily - who was created as an antidote to Barbie's super-slim frame - is being used to teach us about our bikini body obsession. The brown-haired figure confronts her fears on a trip to the beach and sees other women there with flaws and scars, making her realise that no one's perfect. Scroll down for video . In the new Lammily advert the 'average barbie' is shown with stretch marks, the ad is meant to highlight the pressures women are under to be bikini ready . Highlighting the pressures on women to look 'swimwear ready,' at all times the magazine reads, 'Are you bikini ready?' She then starts looking at her friend's Facebook page where they have posted a bikini picture with the mocking hashtags, #plasticperfection, #donthate, #thighgapclub, #bikinibody, #youknowit. In what seems to be a parody of the Victoria's Secret show - famous for its underwear clad models - two barbies then start twerking on a stage as average Barbie looks on. She is then confronted by adverts for a 'dolly tuck,' and one which says you can lose half an inch in two weeks - a reference to the dolls small waists. In the advert Lammily is constantly faced with adverts which tell her she can lose weight quickly - the same images women see in real life . The doll is initially seen with red cheeks when she gets to the beach because she is embarrassed by her bikini body . However when she finally heads to the beach average Lammily realises that everyone there has their own issues. Some have stretch marks, others have spots and one has a scar across her stomach. The dolls creator Nickolay Lamm, a digital artist who majored in marketing at the University of Pittsburgh, said of making the ad: 'I was thinking about how Lammily, in the fashion doll world, would feel very out of place. I think one of the hardest things to do in life is to be yourself.' Lammily also looks at magazines which ask her 'Are you beach ready?' When Lammily sees the other dolls on the beach she soon realises that they all have their issues with their bodies . Lammily was first created in 2014 as the result of a crowd-funding project. Nickolay felt that there was no doll on the market that represented real women. More than 13,000 people signed up to the project with 19,000 of the dolls being pre-ordered. You can buy clothes to fit on the doll as well as stickers which show scars, stretch marks and acne just like normal women have. Nickolay, speaking in the Pittsburgh Post Gazette, said: 'I’m an artist, plus event planner, email checker, data entry person, graphic designer and pizza delivery driver. My goal isn’t to make a ton of money. I just want to create the most awesome content on the Internet.' If you buy a Lammily doll then you can buy stickers to go on her - for example these stretch mark stickers which show the marks many women have on their bodies . Lammily has stretch marks herself which she proudly shows off as she DJs a party on the beach for her friends .",

    "article": "The tactics used by Tory chairman Grant Shapps to convince people to hand over cash so he could get them 'stinking, filthy rich' have been revealed. Mr Shapps, posing as his business guru alter-ego Michael Green, used online leaflets to boast of his wealth and status in a bid to prove that he knew how to make millions. Using pictures of himself in his private plane and six-bedroom mansion, the future Tory minister offered his 'friends' the chance to learn how to make their fortune –as long as they handed him $197, worth £130. Scroll down for video . Mr Shapps used pictures of himself in his private plane with his son in a bid to prove that he knew how to make millions . Mr Shapps said his wealth was 'hard-core' evidence of that he could help people get rich. The revelations come just days after Mr Shapps, 46, faced calls to quit after being forced to admit he had continued to offer get-rich-quick advice after becoming a Conservative MP despite vehement denials to the contrary. The Tory minister had insisted he had not had a second job since being elected MP for Welwyn Hatfield in May 2005, but was later forced to admit he had 'screwed up' by denying the allegations 'over firmly'. It comes after a recording emerged from 2006, a year after he was elected to Parliament, capturing the MP selling self-help guide Stinking Rich 3 and claiming his products could make listeners a 'ton of cash'. The full extent of his toe-curling sales pitch was published in the Sunday Mirror today after pictures were published on the website Political Scrapbook. In it he offers punters the chance to buy his toolkit on 'How To Become Stinking RICH Online' for $197 – even though he claimed it was worth $100,000. The toolkit, he claimed, would make those who bought it '11 to 22 times more successful than the crowd as a result'. Mr Shapps boasted about how he made a fortune in just 30 months from his HowToCorp firm and other projects. Pictured in his sports car he wrote: 'That's me... and I'm sitting in my brandspanking-new Crossfire Convertible 3.2L' But he warned punters they would have to move fast because he had taken the 'difficult decision' to limit supply to just 250 copies, saying: 'I will delete the webpage and the mastercopy of this toolkit'. Mr Shapps offered his online kit to people throughout the UK and across the world from his HowToCorp business based in North West London. He wrote: 'Since owning an online business has enabled me to live in a $2m home... to drive 3 high-end luxury cars and to own and operate my own aircraft, I suppose a toolkit that exposes every secret used to build that kind of wealth should rightfully sell for say $100,000.' Mr Shapps boasts about how he made a fortune in just 30 months from his HowToCorp firm and other projects. The letter, published in 2004, featured Mr Shapps posing in his luxury sports car with the caption: 'That's me... and I'm sitting in my brandspanking-new Crossfire Convertible 3.2L (delivered Saturday July 24). It's one of the first dozen on the road here in the UK.' Tory chairman Grant Shapps faced calls to resign last week after admitting he had had a second job while working as an MP . But he revealed he and wife Belinda also own a 'wonderful Elan Turbo'. The car, he says, is 'complete with in-car DVD, SatNav and just about every other refinement you could imagine in a vehicle. Why it even has a fridge!' He also boasts about his lavish six-bedroom house in Hertfordshire and its new extension. Next to a picture of him sitting in a plane with his son, he writes: 'Everyone a hobby. Mine's flying. But buying and maintaining an aircraft (and this is my second machine) isn't cheap! 'But I just hate to rent... So I took out my pocket-book and bought a plane. That's me and my son in the cockpit. (One of us is a three-year-old with a passion for flying :)' Revelations about Mr Shapps' methods comes just days after he was branded a 'liar and a bully' for threatening a constituents with legal action for highlighting the fact he had a second job. Dean Archer, 50, said he had feared losing his family home after Mr Shapps warned he would take him to court over a Facebook post that mentioned his internet sales sideline as Michael Green. Despite the revelations David Cameron last week insisted he had full confidence in the Conservative party chairman. He said: 'Grant did have another job when he first became an MP and he declared that in the Register of Members' Interests which is what you are meant to do. 'But he obviously made a mistake by saying in some interviews that the work had stopped earlier than it had. He's put that right so I think we can put that behind him. He's doing a good job.'",

    "article": "(CNN)Hillary Clinton made it clear Tuesday that when it comes to her emails, which traveled through a private server during her time at the State Department, we'll all just have to trust -- and she'll verify. Using strong language, the former secretary of state insisted that despite concerns from both sides of the aisle on issues including national security, accountability and transparency, there's simply nothing to see here. \"I went above and beyond what I was requested to do,\" she said. \"I fully complied with every rule,\" she declared. And in case you were wondering if there was going to be an independent review of her emails, there isn't. Nor will she turn over her server. \"The server will remain private.\" There you go. Defiant, unfazed, undeterred.  You can believe fact checkers will work overtime to parse the bit about complying with every rule. Even the White House has disagreed with that. As for everyone else, the question isn't whether Clinton did enough Tuesday to satisfy House Republicans, who will no doubt continue to hammer her on decisions she made while at State. Nor is it whether she did enough to satisfy Republican voters, who have a crystallized view of Clinton that goes all the way back to the '90s. The perception that this is just another in a long line of instances where the Clintons flouted the rules is fairly unshakable. Likewise, her cadre of loyal surrogates, who showed just how unhinged they are willing to sound to defend the irreproachable HRC in recent days, are sure to keep on circling the wagons and telling us that she is the victim of a right-wing smear campaign and -- wait for it -- media bias. The audience for whom this press conference mattered most was Democratic and independent voters, who may admire Hillary Clinton, but as history has proved, simply cannot be counted on to vote for her in 2016, especially if someone else comes along on her left. Remember, Clinton wasn't defeated in 2008 by Republicans. She was beaten by a little-known, inexperienced Democrat. That means that the half of the country that was predisposed to like her politics and who already knew who she was chose someone else. And the other half of the country did, too. She's just as vulnerable, if not more, to the same kind of usurpation in 2016, thanks to an even greater sense of inevitability on the left, and the reflexive rush to protect her from valid questions and criticism isn't helping to dissolve it. Instead of insisting she did nothing wrong and smugly placating nosy reporters, she should have promised these voters that transparency and accountability -- two words she didn't utter Tuesday -- are the cornerstones of good government and any future administration she were to run. She should have assured them that the rules do apply to her, just like anyone else, and that in the future she'll pay closer attention to them. Finally, she should have told them that the last thing she wants is to take the trust of the voters for granted, and that she'll comply with any independent investigation that's offered. Defiance has paid off for the Clintons in that they've made it through some truly breathtaking scandals unscathed. But if Clinton wants 2016 to turn out differently than 2008, she and her surrogates can't keep insisting to voters that she is above scrutiny.",

Cupp: At press conference, Hillary Clinton insists there was nothing amiss with her use of personal email while secretary of state .\nClinton is not invulnerable: She risks losing Democratic and independent voters, who abandoned her in 2008, she says .\nCupp: She should have assured them that the rules do apply to her, that transparency and accountability matter .",

Scrummy: Rugby-loving Amy Brown, 21, from the Forest of Dean is a finalist in the Miss England competition . Beauty and brains: Amy turned to the rugby pitch after her schoolmates teased her for being clever...she says that 'she's now having the last laugh' Nearly ten years on, Amy has blossomed into a young beauty, so much so that her friends suggested she enter a local beauty pageant. Last month she was crowned Miss Forest of Dean, just in time for the Six Nations. Amy, who stands 5ft 8ins tall, will swap her muddy boots for high heels when she competes in the semi-finals of Miss England in June. Amy, who is studying Criminology at the University of Gloucester, said: 'I never expected to come this far. I've never been into high heels and dresses.

The first time I put on high heels I tottered about and almost lost my balance so I've had to practice loads. 'It's a great feeling to get glammed up now, especially when I think back to the abuse I got from the bullies. I do feel like I've had the last laugh.'",

    "article": "A BRIEF GUIDE TO THE SOUND OF MUSIC . by Paul Simpson . (Robinson £9.99) For years I’d thought it was Vera Lynn’s We’ll Meet Again they planned to broadcast when the atomic bombs fell, but according to Paul Simpson, in this essential guide to the iconic film, when a nuclear strike is imminent, the BBC intends filling the airwaves with songs from The Sound Of Music. Cynical sorts will argue that having to listen to Do-Re-Mi and My Favourite Things will only make them incredibly impatient for oblivion. Nevertheless the remaining powers-that-be sincerely hope to ‘maintain some semblance of normality’ by exposing us to the ever-optimistic Von Trapps. It has always been easy to sneer at ‘three hours of nuns yodelling’, and Christopher Plummer himself dubbed the picture The Sound Of Mucus. But I for one love it, perhaps because 50 years back my grandmother took me to see it six times at the Capitol Cinema in Cardiff. The Sound of Music could have been very different if the Osmonds had claimed a place in the film . I always hid under the seat when the Nazis prowled around the convent, and to this day I haven’t seen the bit where the nuns sabotage the cars. It was a film that appealed to women who had domineering husbands — all those glowering Captain Von Trapp sorts who expected their dinner to be on the table. My grandmother, and millions like her, would love to have been Julie Andrews, cutting up the curtains to make clothes, falling in lakes for fun, rebelliously cycling around the countryside, picnicking and generally being heedless of chores and domestic obligations. In its unlikely and unstrident way, The Sound Of Music was a pioneering feminist rallying cry, and ordinary women, who’d have had no earthly inkling what Germaine Greer was rabbiting on about, embraced it and identified with it. The first surprise in Simpson’s book is that the story begins in England. The Von Trapps were descended from Robert Whitehead, an engineer born in Bolton in 1823. He went abroad to work for a Milanese company and in Trieste, then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, he built ‘the first cylindrical marine boiler’ and helped design armour-plated frigates for Kaiser Franz-Josef’s navy. Whitehead’s granddaughter, Agatha, met Captain Georg Von Trapp when he was visiting the factory looking at torpedoes. Julie Andrews (centre) is pictured in 1965 on the set of The Sound of Music with her on-screen step-children . They were married in 1911 and had seven children. Agatha died of scarlet fever in 1922, and Georg moved as a widower to Salzburg. A 21-year-old nun came to help out with the family — Maria Augusta Kutschera. She’d entered the convent, Nonnberg Abbey, to escape abusive uncles and cousins. Exactly as in the film, she was a tomboyish postulant, always having to be rebuked for sliding down banisters, climbing on the roof, jumping over chimneys, and grabbing the other nuns to tickle their ribs. Georg was entranced, and he married his new nanny in 1927. But how much of a mutual love-match was it? Maria ‘suggested to Georg that he go on the honeymoon without her’. At least they could make music. Like Plummer, Georg peeped on a bosun’s whistle to call the children to order, and he accompanied them on a guitar when they had a singing session. By the way, Ronald Reagan sincerely believed that Edelweiss was the official national anthem of Austria. After they’d sung a selection of medieval church music at the Salzburg Festival in 1936, the Von Trapps were invited abroad on tours. They sang before Queen Mary in London and entertained the Pope at the Vatican. It is here that the movie differs from reality. In real life the family left by train for a series of engagements, crossing the Channel and taking a ship from Southampton for New York, arriving in America in October 1938. Though Georg had been reprimanded by the Gestapo for failing to fly the Nazi flag after the Anschluss, there was no actual immediate danger. The five eldest Osmonds (pictured in 1972) are said to have begged to be able to play the Von Trapp children in the famous film . According to Hollywood, however, the Von Trapps crept from the concert hall, hid behind the Nonnberg tombs, and climbed every mountain to freedom carrying heavy instrument cases. In fact, had Julie Andrews, Christopher Plummer and the children kept going on the route they’d chosen, they’d have soon arrived on the terrace in Hitler’s Berchtesgaden.That part of Austria borders Bavaria, not Switzerland. And may I also state for the record that there is no such dish as ‘Schnitzel and Noodles’. The closest you’d find is ‘Gulasch mit Nockerln’. The original Maria Von Trapp was diddled by agents and managers, who persuaded her to sell them the global rights to her story in perpetuity for a paltry flat fee of $10,000, so neither she nor the family made a further penny cent from any of the adaptations. Twentieth Century Fox didn’t even invite Maria to the premiere, in case she ‘eclipsed’ Julie Andrews. I was shocked to discover that many major talents had shunned the chance to put the proven hit on the big screen. Neither Gene Kelly nor Billy Wilder would touch it, as ‘no musical with swastikas in it can be a success’. Rex Harrison, Bing Crosby and Yul Brynner turned down the role of Captain Von Trapp, believing the man to be ‘very much a cardboard figure, humourless and one-dimensional’. Audrey Hepburn, Doris Day and Anne Bancroft didn’t fancy donning a wimple. Audrey Hepburn (left) is said to have turned down the role of Maria, while Bing Crosby (right) rejected the part of Captain Von Trapp, believing it to be 'a cardboard figure' Noel Coward rejected the part of Max, the impresario — a shame. He’d have been brilliant. By contrast, the five eldest Osmonds begged to play the Von Trapp children. They were rejected, thank God, though Marie Osmond was to strum a guitar and play Maria on stage in the Seventies. Of those Aryan-looking youngsters who were finally cast, after their 11 weeks on location in Salzburg and the glorious Salzkammergut in 1964, none was to go on to great things. In late middle age by now, they are variously software designers, flower arrangers, nurses or interior decorators. Regarding the authentic Von Trapps, incidentally, they stopped singing professionally in 1956 and settled in Vermont, where they ran a hotel that burned down in 1980. Maria died in 1987, Georg having long predeceased her, in 1947. Life was never as rosy as in the film: one of the children had electroconvulsive shock treatment for depression, another married a Canadian, and others became dairy farmers. To date there have been 116 cast albums from the innumerable stage productions of The Sound of Music. (The Connie Fisher version lasted from 2006 until 2011.) Sing-a-Long parties are wildly popular, with the audience in costume — I’d go myself but in a nun outfit I do keep being mistaken for Pam Ferris as Sister Angelina. Julie Andrews (left) and Christopher Plummer (right) won the two top roles in the famous film, playing Maria and Captain Von Trapp respectively . The Julie Andrews film is the third highest grossing movie in history, behind Gone With The Wind and Star Wars. (Pre-tax profits of $20 million by 1966 saved Fox from the near-bankruptcy it faced after the Elizabeth Taylor/Richard Burton Cleopatra.) DVD and Blu-ray sales remain buoyant, with an ever-burgeoning number of special features and documentaries. The only place where it has never caught on, ironically, is Austria, where Captain Von Trapp is considered a deserter, which he was if you think about it. The Von Trapp villa became Himmler’s headquarters during the war. The film was also heavily edited in France, where it was felt that nuns shouldn’t be seen singing non-religious songs. For the rest of us, it is more than a movie. The Sound of Music is intimately bound up with childhood memories and emotions, in my case going to Cardiff for all those mid-week matinees, escaping the South Wales coal dust for the pristine Austrian panoramas. Indeed, years later I bought a flat near Salzburg. I’ve done my best to live where the hills are alive — though in actuality they are not these days alive with Rodgers & Hammerstein. What you hear are oompah-bands and men in lederhosen slapping their thighs and playing Wagner by blowing down the tube of a milking machine. Once seen, never forgotten. Especially by the cows. By the way, do get the latest incarnation of the DVD, as it includes an all-new documentary: Julie Andrews Returns To Salzburg. You see, she wasn’t able to leave the film behind either.",

    "prediction": "The article discusses the film \"The Sound of Music,\" which was based on the true story of the Von Trapp family. The family, led by Captain Von Trapp, fled Nazi Germany in 1938 and settled in Salzburg, Austria. The film, directed by Frederick Kohner, was released in 1965 and starred Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer. The article highlights the differences between the film and the real story, including the fact that the Von Trapps did not actually escape by train, and that the film's depiction of the family's adventures was heavily edited in France."

    "article": "Dinner with Arnold Palmer on Thursday night clearly agreed with World No 1 Rory McIlroy. All those indifferent rounds in Florida so far this year were swept aside on Friday as the Northern Irishman notched up five birdies in a row at one point on his way to a superb 66 at the Arnold Palmer Invitational. It was the first time in eight rounds in the Sunshine State this year that he had broken 70 and what a way to do it. From out of the pack, the 25 year old is now bang in contention for a morale-boosting victory in his last scheduled start before his attempt to complete the career Grand Slam at the Masters next month. Rory McIlroy hit a second round of 66 at the Arnold Palmer Invitational on Friday . It was the first time in eight rounds in Florida this year that the World No 1 had broken 70 . McIlroy looks to have played himself back into form ahead of the Masters next month . ‘I’m just feeling more comfortable day by day, and it was great to see a few putts finally drop,’ said McIlroy, whose performance drew a glowing tribute from his good friend and playing partner, Rickie Fowler. ‘After what I saw today and the fact he’s clearly the best player in the world, he has to be the favourite for the Masters,’ said the American, who was pipped at the post to both The Open and USPGA Championships last year by McIlroy. ‘That course suits his game. He didn’t start out hot today but when he gets it going as he did on the back nine, it’s hard to hang with him. If he continues to play like that, he will be ready for Augusta, for sure.’ Fowler was right when he said nothing appeared to be happening for McIlroy over his front nine, the inward half on the course. In fact, he’d played much better on the first day, when he opened with a 70. But after finally getting a putt to drop at the second, and enjoying a small stroke of fortune at the third, where his pulled drive carried a water hazard by just a couple of yards, it all started to click. A good wedge to the third green set up a birdie and then came his third in a row at the par five fourth. At the fifth his wedge shot finished 18 inches away and then came another birdie at the long sixth, where he got up and down from a greenside bunker. ‘It’s a lovely feeling when you get on runs like that and the game suddenly feels very easy,’ he said. Fowler's good friend and playing partner Rickie Fowler admitted McIlroy is now favourite for the Masters . McIlroy had five birdies in a row in Dubai earlier this year but this was the first time he had enjoyed such a run in an event on the PGA Tour, and it electrified the huge galleries at Bay Hill. By this stage he had gone from being nowhere near the leader board into a tie for second place. Not even a bogey at his penultimate hole could dampen his enthusiasm. ‘It was obviously not the finish I was looking for but I’m still exactly where I wanted to be, with a real chance to win the tournament going into the weekend,’ he said. McIlroy will actually begin the third round on Saturday five shots behind American pacesetter, Morgan Hoffmann, who has played brilliantly so far to post blistering rounds of 66 and 65. But can the little-known Hoffmann keep it going? The New Jersey native is the same age as 25 year old McIlroy but there the comparison ends. A solitary top three finish in 67 starts on the PGA Tour suggests he could struggle over the weekend. Three shots off the pace are world No 3 Henrik Stenson and defending champion Matt Every, while McIlroy is not the only big name from the UK in position to have a crack at winning this prestigious title. Matt Every is also in the mix, three shots behind surprise leader Morgan Hoffman . Ian Poulter is in contention at halfway after rounds of 67 and 70 put him one shot behind McIlroy . For the third week out of four in Florida, Ian Poulter is in contention at halfway, standing just a shot behind McIlroy following rounds of 67 and 70. He also gave a positive bulletin on his three year old son, Joshua, who is making a good recovery from pneumonia. ‘It was great to see him looking a lot perkier than when I left for the course this morning,’ he said. Padraig Harrington, who began this Florida swing with an amazing comeback victory at the Honda Classic, is also in the top 20 at halfway after rounds of 68 and 71. But there’s no getting away from the man who will attract nearly all the attention this weekend. As for that dinner with Palmer, McIlroy was still buzzing. ‘It was fantastic, it really was,’ he said. ‘We spoke for two and a half hours and he was telling stories of the old days and some of the things he’ s done from a commercial standpoint. He was very close to his father just like I am and he shared a few stories about that. It was just great to be in his presence and enjoy his company.’ Pat Perez hits his tee-shot on the picturesque 11th hole at the Bay Hill Club and Lodge .",

Neil Tregarthen devoted six weeks to gathering information for a 15-page report that named their prime suspect – but officers dismissed it as ‘rumour and speculation’ and abandoned the case. Yesterday the millionaire former business owner – who posed as an angler at one stage to spy on youths he believed were responsible – criticised the police investigation as ‘totally impotent’. Scroll down for video . Neil Tregarthen spent £10,000 on a private investigator after his daughter's cat, Farah, was shot by an air rifle . He and the private eyes identified several members of a local gang that posted Facebook pages of themselves injuring animals, and had criminal records for air rifle related offences. But police refused to bring a prosecution because of ‘lack of evidence’ for an attack that condemned Farah the kitten to a slow, agonising death. Mr Tregarthen’s daughter Aylish was horrified to find Farah lying in a pool of blood after limping home wounded and crippled with pain last September. The 24-year-old medical student and her father took the kitten to a vet but she suffered ‘a very long, painful, lingering death’ from a ruptured bowel and blood poisoning, finally passing away on the operating table, Mr Tregarthen said. When police told him there was not enough evidence to pursue the case he hired the detective firm and offered a £1,000 reward to catch the killer. They distributed flyers and set up a phone line for people to give information. It quickly became clear there had been a string of air rifle attacks near where Aylish lives in Exeter, Devon. ‘We narrowed it down to four youths, so we set about doing surveillance work,’ Mr Tregarthen said. ‘We would camp out on the river pretending to be fishing. We surveyed certain areas by pretending to be members of the public. Ideally we needed to witness an incident, but that never happened. We found a witness who claimed he had witnessed our main suspect shooting another cat.’ The kitten, pictured right with one of the family's other pets,  died despite extensive treatment at the vets . Mr Tregarthen is offering £1,000 to anyone with information which could lead to Farah's killer. The kitten was shot near her owner's home in Exeter . Exeter-based Focus Investigations, whose staff includes ex-police officers, said the person responsible had ‘an obvious sociopathic nature’. Mr Tregarthen, 56, added: ‘We compiled all the information we had, and presented it to the police. We did 85 per cent of the work – then Devon and Cornwall Police would not even go and knock on a couple of doors. Using an air rifle to shoot cats is illegal, and should be treated as such.’ Mr Tregarthen, who lives in a luxury house in Truro, Cornwall, said of the cost of his own investigation: ‘I would pay double that if I thought it would stop this sort of behaviour. 'I know I am in a fortunate position to be able to do so, but I think it is money well spent. It’s about society fighting back.’ Mr Tregarthen enlisted the help of private investigators Focus (offices pictured above) to help find Farah's killer . The animal is likely to have been playing in the garden when killed, Mr Tregarthen said. She returned to Miss Tregarthen's house wounded . His daughter said: ‘I feel like there is no justification for not investigating something that is illegal. We sympathise with the budget cuts – they have limited time and resources, which is why we chose to investigate it. But to still have the same response is very disappointing.’ Devon and Cornwall Police neighbourhood beat manager Steve Parsons said: ‘We investigated this crime fully. As for the investigation report, I have examined this and it is packed with rumour and speculation, not evidence. ‘However, on the back of this, officers did make further inquiries in the area which also turned out to be fruitless. I am confident we have done everything possible in investigating this case.’ Mr Tregarthen said police were 'impotent' in their investigations into who killed the cat, pictured above in a red collar . Mr Tregarthen lives in a plush £3million home in Truro, Cornwall (above). His daughter is studying medicine in Exeter .",
